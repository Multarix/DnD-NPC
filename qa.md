	<h3 class="inline">So what does this thing do?</h3>

		<p class="description">DnD-NPC allows you to quickly and easily create random NPC's.<br>
		The main use for this is to help quickly create an NPC that a DM can adapt into a campaign.</p></div>
	<br>
	<h3 class="inline">How does it work?</h3>

		<p class="description">Magic. Just kidding.<br/>
	It works by taking either user input to determine the character race and class, to then create "random" aspects of an NPC such as their alignment, gender or even weapon.<br>
	To see the full information it currently provides, <a href="./usage.html#output">see here</a>.</p></div>

	<h3 class="inline">I don't like X thing about the NPC this created!</h3>

	<div class="embed qa showHide" id="33">
		<p class="description">Nothing stopping you from taking the bits you do like and adapting the NPC to how YOU like it!<br>
	Don't like its name? Change it to something you like.<br>
	Don't like its weapon? Change it!<br>
	As said before, the goal is to <i>help</i> create an NPC that a DM can adapt into their campaign.<br>
	I take no offence if you don't like an aspect, I mean it WAS randomly generated.</p></div>

	<h3 class="inline">I just updated to the latest version and X thing broke!</h3>

	<div class="embed qa showHide" id="55">
		<p class="description">It depends. I'm not going to generate your characters appearance (aside from gender and age) for instance.<br>
	Create an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/Multarix/DnD-NPC/issues">github</a> with a feature request and I'll take a look at it.</p></div>
