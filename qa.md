# Q&A
<div class="main">
	<h3>So what does this thing do?</h3>
	<button class="btn default" id="1" onClick="showHide('1', '11')" type="button">Show</button>
	<p id="11">DnD-NPC allows you to quickly and easily create random NPC's.<br>
	The main use for this is to help quickly create an NPC that a DM can adapt into a campaign.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>How does it work?</h3>
	<button class="btn default" id="2" onClick="showHide('2', '22')" type="button">Show</button>
	<p id ="22">Magic. Just kidding.<br/>
	It works by taking either user input to determine the character race and class, to then create "random" aspects of an NPC such as their alignment, gender or even weapon.<br>
	To see the full information it currently provides, <a href="./usage.html#output">see here</a>.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>I don't like X thing about the NPC this created!</h3>
	<button class="btn default" id="3" onClick="showHide('3', '33')" type="button">Show</button>
	<p id="33">And? Nothing stopping you from taking the bits you do like and adapting the NPC to how YOU like it.<br>
	Don't like its name? Change it to something you like.<br>
	Don't like its weapon? Change it!<br>
	As said before, the goal is to <i>help</i> create an NPC that a DM can adapt into their campaign.<br>
	I take no offence if you don't like an aspect, I mean it WAS randomly generated.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>I just updated to the latest version and X thing broke!</h3>
	<button class="btn default" id="4" onClick="showHide('4', '44')" type="button">Show</button>
	<p id="44">Please check the <a href="./changelog.html">changelog</a> to make sure this was an intended change.<br>
	If it was not, create an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/Multarix/DnD-NPC/issues">github</a> and I'll take a look at it.<br>
	Better yet, if you know whats causing it, fix it and create a pull request!.</p>

	<h3>Can you make it generate X information?</h3>
	<button class="btn default" id="5" onClick="showHide('5', '55')" type="button">Show</button>
	<p id="55">It depends. I'm not going to generate your characters appearance (aside from gender and age) for instance.<br>
	Create an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/Multarix/DnD-NPC/issues">github</a> with a feature request and I'll take a look at it.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Why do you use role instead of class</h3>
	<button class="btn default" id="6" onClick="showHide('6', '66')" type="button">Show</button>
	<p id="66">Because Javascript hates RPG players.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Can I help contribute to this project?</h3>
	<button class="btn default" id="7" onClick="showHide('7', '77')" type="button">Show</button>
	<p id="77">Sure! Create a fork, make changes, create pull request. Simple as that!</p>
