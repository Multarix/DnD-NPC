### Q&A
#### So what does this thing do?
DnD-NPC allows you to quickly and easily create random NPC's.<br>
The main use for this is to help quickly create an NPC that a DM can adapt into a campaign.

#### How does it work?
Magic. Just kidding.<br/>
It works by taking either user input to determine the character race and class, to then create "random" aspects of an NPC such as their alignment, gender or even weapon.<br>
To see the full information it currently provides, [see here](./pages/usage#output).

#### I don't like X thing about the NPC this created!
And? Nothing stopping you from taking the bits you do like and adapting the NPC to how YOU like it.<br>
Don't like its name? Change it to something you like.<br>
Don't like its weapon? Change it!<br>
As said before, the goal is to _help_ create an NPC that a DM can adapt into their campaign.<br>
I take no offence if you don't like an aspect, I mean it WAS randomly generated.

#### I just updated to the latest version and X thing broke!
Please check the [changelog](./changelog) to make sure this was an intended change.<br>
If it was not, create an issue on the [github](https://github.com/Multarix/DnD-NPC/issues) and I'll take a look at it.<br>
Better yet, if you know whats causing it, fix it and create a pull request!.

#### Can you make it generate X information?
It depends. I'm not going to generate your characters appearance (aside from gender and age) for instance.<br>
Create an issue on the [github](https://github.com/Multarix/DnD-NPC/issues) with a feature request and I'll take a look at it.

#### Why do you use role instead of class
Because Javascript hates RPG players.

#### Can I help contribute to this project?
Sure! Create a fork, make changes, create pull request. Simple as that!
